Challenge 1

Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled.

For example:

[1, 2, 3] --> [2, 4, 6]

Answer: 

function maps(x){
  return x.map(n => n * 2);
}



Challenge 2

Implement a function which multiplies two numbers.

let multiply = (x, y) => x * y;


Challenge 3

Complete the function that takes a non-negative integer n as input, 
and returns a list of all the powers of 2 with the exponent ranging from 0 to n ( inclusive ).

Examples:
n = 0  ==> [1]        # [2^0]
n = 1  ==> [1, 2]     # [2^0, 2^1]
n = 2  ==> [1, 2, 4]  # [2^0, 2^1, 2^2]

Answer:

function powersOfTwo(n){
  let result = [];
  for (var i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    result.push(Math.pow(2, i));
  }
  return result;
}



Challenge 4

Given a non-negative integer, 3 for example, return a string with a murmur: "1 sheep...2 sheep...3 sheep...". 
Input will always be valid, i.e. no negative integers.

Answer:

var countSheep = function (num){
  let numberOfSheep = '';
  for(let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
     numberOfSheep += `${i} sheep...`;
  }
  return numberOfSheep
}


Challenge 5

Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. 
If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

Answer:

function lovefunc(flower1, flower2){
  if(flower1 % 2 === 0 && flower2 % 2 !== 0) {
    return true;
  } else if(flower1 % 2 !==0 && flower2 % 2 === 0){
    return true;
  } else {
    return false
  }
}
